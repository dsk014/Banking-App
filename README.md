# **Program Description**

This application simulates a basic banking system through a text-based menu:

1️ **Add Account** – Creates a new account with a unique account number and customer name.  
2️ **Get Accounts** – Displays all existing accounts and their balances.  
3️ **Deposit** – Adds money to a selected account and records the transaction.  
4️ **Withdraw** – Withdraws money from a selected account if sufficient balance exists.  
5️ **View Transaction History** – Shows all past deposits and withdrawals for a chosen account.  
6️ **Exit** – Safely terminates the application.

Each account keeps a personal transaction history (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, and initial balance creation).
